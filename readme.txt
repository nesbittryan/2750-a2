CIS*2750 Assignment 2

Assumptions I made about the assignment:
    -All posts will will added only using the ./post
    and all authors will be added using only ./addauthor
    -If you try to add a post or edit the stream file it
    will become invalid due to the byte count in stream data,
    and the stream list to possibly become wrong
    -Another thing I did was when viewing the messages, it starts
    with the oldest unread message, and goes down until they are all
    read, and then lists the previously read messages.
